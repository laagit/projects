This project is a sinple blockchain that runs locally. 
Decide the hash difficulty, add as many transactions as you want and watch the output as your computer tries to find a nonce that results in a sha256 hash that starts with the required amount of zeroes. Add as many blocks as you wish and print out the final blockchain.
